Simple micro-service to demonstrate CRUD, search and bulk load. This project still has a long todo list. Some of the items are listed below:
* Fix Janava 10 - gradle issues
* Generate documentation on build
* Bundle documentation into jar
* Make documentation available in running jar
* Complete search function
* Integration test for search function (relys on hibernate so impractical to unit test)
* Merge search and CRUD endpoints (different controllers, same endpoint if practical)
* Determine best method for bulk loading, multi-part, modified json, other?
